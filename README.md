# FAANG-Interview-Questions

1. Two Sum -- Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a given target.
2. Max Area -- You are given an array of positve integers where each integer represents the height og the vertical line on a chart. Find two lines which together with the x-axis forms a container that would hold the greatest ammount of water. Return the are of water it would hold.
3. Trapped Water -- Given an array of integers representing am elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, return how much rainwater can be trapped.
4. Typed Out String -- Given two strings S and T return if they equal when both are typed out. Any '#' that appears in the string counts as a backspace.
5. Longest SubString -- Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
6. Palindrome --   Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case sensitivity.
7. Almost Palindrome -- Given a string, determine if it is almost a palindrome. A string is almost a palindrome if it becomes a palindrome by removing 1 letter.Consider only aplhanumeric characters and ignore case sensitivity.
8. Reverse Linked List -- Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
9. Reversal Linked List -- Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.
10. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List -- You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below. Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.
11. String to Integer -- Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
12. Reverse Integer -- Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
13. Move Zeros -- Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
